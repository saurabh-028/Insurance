# Aim
Health insurance has become an indispensable part of our lives in recent years, and people are paying for it so that they are covered in the event of an accident or other unpredicted factors.
You are provided with medical costs dataset that has features such as Age, Cost, BMI.

Objective:
Determine the factors that contribute the most in the calculation of insurance costs.
Predict the eligiblity to health Insurance.

## About

This webapp was developed using Flask Web Framework and was deployed on microsoft azure server. The models used to predict whether a person can claim health insurance were trained on large Datasets. All the links for datasets and the python notebooks used for model creation are mentioned below in this readme.

## Dataset Links

All the datasets were used from kaggle can be found in below link also images of samples.

## Aim / Purpose
Online Malaria Detector - Detects sample weather it is infected with malaria or not this model uses CNN (convolutional neural network) for classifying the images ,This project aims to demonstrate how online disease prediction/detection through Machine learning can save time and prove helpful for remote areas and villages also this helps in digitalization of records and error free mechanism saving time  cost and energy

## About

This webapp was developed using Flask Web Framework and was deployed on Heroku server. The models used to predict the diseases were trained on large Datasets. All the links for datasets and the python notebooks used for model creation are mentioned below in this readme. The webapp can predict following Diseases:
## Future scope

Multiple Disease detectors can be made by taking more accurate datasets training the models model for various diseases. 
Sytem if efficiently Designed will be helpful in faster report generation and treatment decreasing workload.
This system will have Digital copy of medical records and will provehelpful in telemedicine and virtual consultancy.
Saves Time work and energy gives error free result. 
People living in Remote areas and villages they can get their sample report to their mobiles and would reduce the travel to hospital everytime.
Overall wil;l result in Developing smart healtyh Ecosystem.



- **Malaria**

## Models with their Accuracy of Prediction

| Disease        | Type of Model            | Accuracy |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | -------- |
| Malaria     |    Deep Learning Model(CNN) | 96%      |
